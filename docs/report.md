## Project Objectives
######  Value delivered to your client:
During the five week period given to us by the customer, Ben, we were able to deliver a product up to the standards of the customer. After the end of each sprint, weekly interval, we received feedback from the customer, which we took and transformed the product in the direction of the customer. Overall, we received positive feedback and approval from the customer.

## Project Design
###### Team goals:
Our team goal is to deliver a high quality product that meets the needs and values of our customers. We planned to hit all the user cases provided to us by the customer. The user cases provided by the customer consisted of applying filters for a job search; uploading a pdf that is saved to the user profiles, and being able to apply to a job relatively quickly (quick apply). Along with those large criteria, we wanted the user interface to be user friendly and usable. Lastly, to create a welcoming and friendly environment for the team.

###### User stories completed:
During the five week period we completed a total of 35 stories for 197 points. We estimated a total of 38 stories for 231. The reason for the discrepancies has to do with overplanning stories, as well as pushing potential stories we planned to get to but ended up freezing. We have a file dedicated to the specifics of our sprints. If you wish to see more click [here](https://github.com/comp129/customer-project-rayquaza/blob/main/docs/Sprints.md).
