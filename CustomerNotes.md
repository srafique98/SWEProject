# Sprint 1 March 29th - April 5th
## Insights 
  - Customer spent a lot of time trying all the features (Exploring) 
  - When navigating the list, customer was clicking to see if the list would prompt any further actions. 
  - Attempting to use all the filters to see what they would do. At this moment, the customer does not want any UI changes. 

## Feedback
  - UI is approved by the customer. Not much request in terms of graphics
  - Seperate salary by min and max. It will makes ranges better. If possible add a list (drop down).
  - In the future, avoid many columns and merge into one. It should be a single box detailing the current information into a single column.
  - (Optional) For location, if we input "H" then dropdown menu will recommend cities that start with "H". Maybe for job filter as well. 
  - Have a Job title stand out more to make it easier to read/find and bold to stand out more. Other info is smaller so it is not as distacting. 
  - Job description should be populated after clicking a button on the job listing side.
  - The job description should include all the information on the job and an easy way to apply.
